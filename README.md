# React Travel Blog

## About this project
This travel blog was created as part of the Fullstack Web Development course at Hamburg Coding School. It is a practice project to learn React, backend APIs, MongoDB, and working with MapTiler.

The goal was to create a simple but functional blog with map integration and reusable components.

## Data Persistence with MongoDB & API Integration
All content of the Travel Blog (e.g. travel posts) is persistently stored in a MongoDB database. The data is managed through a custom-built REST API, maintained in a separate Git repository, which serves as the backend for this React application.
